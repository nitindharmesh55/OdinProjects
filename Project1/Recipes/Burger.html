    <h1>Mushroom Veggie Burger</h1>
    <p>These vegetarian mushroom burgers are as close as I've ever gotten to delicious meatless burgers. Mushrooms
        really give them a meaty flavor. I like to serve them on fresh hamburger rolls with spicy mayonnaise and a
        little lettuce.</p>

    <h2>Direction:</h2>

        <li><strong>Step 1:</strong>
        <p>Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add mushrooms, onion, garlic, salt, pepper, and oregano; cook and stir until mushrooms have released their juices and the liquid has evaporated, about 10 minutes. Remove from the heat.</p>

        <li><Strong>Step 2:</Strong>
        <p> Transfer mushrooms to a cutting board and clean the skillet. </p>

        <li><strong>Step 3:</strong>
        <p>Chop mushrooms into small chunks, then transfer to a large bowl. Mix in bread crumbs and oats, and season with salt and pepper as needed. Stir in Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese, then eggs; let stand until bread crumbs have absorbed any excess liquid, about 15 minutes. Use moist hands to form mixture, 1/4 cup at a time, into patties. </p>
