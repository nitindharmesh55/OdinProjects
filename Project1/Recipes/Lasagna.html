    <h1>Homemade Lasagna</h1>
    <p>This is my mom's special homemade lasagna recipe with a meaty, made-from-scratch tomato sauce and a deliciously cheesy filling. A more traditional homemade lasagna filling would be made with ricotta but my mom's recipe calls for a blend of small-curd cottage cheese and Parmesan. I have found none better anywhere. Serve with a leafy green salad and crusty garlic bread.</p>

      <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Meat:</strong>
        <p>This lasagna recipe starts with a pound of ground meat (½ pound ground pork, ½ pound lean ground beef). </p>
        </li>

        <li><strong>Onions:</strong>
        <p>: A diced onion is cooked until translucent with the ground meat.</p>
        </li>

        <li><strong>Canned Tomatoes:</strong>
        <p>You'll need a can of tomato sauce and a can of crushed tomatoes.</p>
        </li>

        <li><strong>Fresh Herbs: </strong>
        <p>For fresh flavor, chop two tablespoons of parsley and crush one clove of garlic.</p>
        </li>

        <li><strong>Sugar:</strong>
        <p> A dash of sugar balances out all of the acidity from the tomatoes.</p>
        </li>

        <li><strong>Spices and seasonings:</strong>
        <p> This homemade lasagna is seasoned with dried basil, dried oregano, salt, and black pepper.</p>
        </li>

        <li><strong>Noodles:</strong>
        <p>Of course, you'll need lasagna noodles! This recipe calls for uncooked </p>
        </li>

        <li><strong>Cheese:</strong>
        <p> The cheese layer is made up of cottage cheese and Parmesan. You'll also need shredded mozzarella.</p>
        </li>

        <li><strong>Eggs:</strong><p>Eggs make the cheese layer extra creamy. Plus, they act as a binding agent (which means they hold the layer together).</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
